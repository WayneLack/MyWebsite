# MyWebsite
The final end goal for this project is create a personal website that is 
actually published with a purchased domain name. This will therefore come 
in several stages before I get anywhere near that end goal. The purpose, 
is for me to slowly learn the languages and techniques of building a 
website. 

A rough outline of the steps I intend to follow are given below. These 
will likely update with more detail as complexity grows, but since I am 
new to this, I don't yet know the whole journey. 
- Phase 1: Create the absolute basic tree structure of html and css files for a website, with assets including any images and 
	other files. This will not be neat, and will be largely incomplete
- Phase 2: Flesh out the structure above with what I want the website to actually look like. I'm thinking a science page, a 
	book-review page, and a recipe page. Ohter ideas will probably inspire me later. At this point, the website will still 
	look terrible and will involve nothing complicated or special.
- Phase 3: Following the basic skeleton of a website, I will look at how to make it actually look nice and would love to add an 
	interactive part to the science bit of the webiste, like a dumb Monte Carlo simulation or something. 
- Phase 4: Consider adding in the actual websitey bits even though its not a real website yet. Things like google analytics, 
	maybe an email chain people can regret signing up to, and an advert to annoy everyone. 
- Phase 5: This is where I am yet to learn anything, but at roughly this stage I would consider buying a domain and actually 
	publishing a real website. This would likely be an overhaul of what I've done, but now I would be armed with the complete 
	structure and a clearer final goal. At this stage, phase 5 is vague, and you'll just have to deal with that.

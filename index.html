    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p>
        This is the landing page of my basic website. The purpose of the website is actually for me to learn basic coding tools. 
        For this reason, there may be weird features that would not be standard of an actual professional website, and you'll just have to deal with it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do enjoy any content that I put out there, which for now should include a few book reviews and some recipes I like. 
        It may well include more interesting physics as time goes on too.
